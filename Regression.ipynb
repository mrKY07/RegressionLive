It assumes that the relationship between them is linear, meaning Y can be predicted from X using a straight-line equation: Y = mX + c. This helps in understanding how changes in X affect Y. It's commonly used for prediction and trend analysis. The model tries to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the distance between the actual and predicted values of Y.\n",
